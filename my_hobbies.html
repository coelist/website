<h1>Hello there! Welcome to my home page, here you will find some interests / hobbies I like. </h1>
<h2>Music</h2>
<div class="city">
<h2>Listening To Music</h2>
<p>Listening to music is my second favorite hobby!</p>
</div>
<p> My favorite thing to do is listen to music. I like to just sit there and let time pass while I sing. 
I feel like I connect with music on a whole different level. Thats why when I hear these songs I get chills 
and butterflies. That is why I want to have my girl over and me and her listening to music. It would be the best. I feel like music is super therapeutic. So i like to listen to music when I am stressed out to calm me down!</p>

<h2>Texting</h2>
<p>Texting is my favorite hobby of them all!</p>
</div>
<p> I love to text my girl. Time flies by faster than anything when I'm texting her. Whenever I get a 
notification from her, my heart pounds a little faster each time. I could talk to her everyday and never 
get bored, ever. </p>

<h4>Photo shop</h4>
<div class="city">
<h2>Fun Fact</h2>
<p>Whenever I text her I always gain feelings for her. Each and every single time</p>
</div>
<h2 id="photoshop">Photoshop</h2>
<p>I love photo shopping. It is a really cool way to edit pictures!</p>
</div>
<p>Another thing I love doing is photo shop. I love being able to put pictures on another pictures and different backgrounds. It's really time consuming since its very fun. You have to be very delicate to use photo shop. 
This is one of my most recent photo shops I've done. I could do better, but I think its pretty good for the first few photo shops.

In conclusion, my favorite hobbies are listening to music, <a href="http://www.repercussionstudios.com/">making music</a>, and being with my girl. These three things are the best 
things to ever come into my life. I also plan to be working soon, so that I can save for a car and buy me some nice things that I work hard for.
